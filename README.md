Explore another quiet, exotic planet with a different perspective !

Luminescence is a walking simulator on an alien planet displayed on four LED panels instead of a screen. The player’s vision is thus restricted as if they were seeing the world from inside an astronaut helmet.

This game was made in 3 and a half day during the Alternative Output Workshop at ENJMIN 2023. The objective was to create a game where the output wouldn't be a regular computer screen.

The game was made using Unity3D and use several LED panels as display.
